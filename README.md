# Selenium quotes parser for Finam

A solution for getting quotes from the Finam website. \
The parser uses the Selenium framework for browser automatization. \
The current solution collects the data for the past year. 

You can adjust your parameters for other graph types and visualization. \
Keep in mind that the date is handled manually, this may lead to some distortions in the collected data if you don't take it into account. 

All the best!
